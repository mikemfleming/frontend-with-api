# Phase 2: Controller Layer

This controller will have a resttful API built into it for the frontend to communicate with. [Read up on rest APIs here](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/rest-api/)

## Step 1: Create an Express server

Reference [the docs](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html) on how to do this.

## Step 2: Create routes and map them to your models

Start by uncommenting the tests in `pets.controller.test.js` and use that as your example to make tests for each route as you go. There should be routes to get all, query, update, and delete pets just like the methods in the models.

When you're done with the routes for pets make tests and routes for sitters.
